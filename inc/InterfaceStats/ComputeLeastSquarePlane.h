Given a list of interface points, this class first computes the least 
squares plane through them.

The problem is defined as, 
	minimize \sum_i d_i
	where, d_i = A x_i + B y_i + C z_i + D

Taking partial derivatives we can show that 
	D = A x_c + B y_c + C z_c
where, (x_c, y_c, z_c) is the centroid of the points.

If we translate the points so that the centroid lies on the origin, then 
the computation can be simplified to show that the solution to the least 
squares problem is the eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix M, where-

m00 = \sum_i (x'_i)^2
m11 = \sum_i (y'_i)^2
m22 = \sum_i (z'_i)^2

m01 = \sum_i (x'_i)(y'_i)
m02 = \sum_i (x'_i)(z'_i)
m12 = \sum_i (y'_i)(z'_i)

where, x' = x - x_c and so on.

The eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue is the normal to the 
least square plane and gives us the values of A, B and C. D can be derived 
from these.

Also the eigenvectors corresponding to the other two eigenvalues are orthogonal
to each other and are the major and minor directions of the projected point set 
on the least square plane.

The least square plane, and the interface point set is used to compute interface 
statistics including the interface area, interface volume, interface width,
gapvolume index etc.
